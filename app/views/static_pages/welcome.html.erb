      <h2>Build literature, together.</h2>
      <p>
        There are two sides to every story. StoryWard is a platform for people to contribute to the process of writing a story collaboratively. A piece of a story is a "node", and nodes are combined together in sequence to make a story. You can "fork" a node, if the node's author allows it, and continue the story in your own words. Build the plot you like best from other user's nodes.
